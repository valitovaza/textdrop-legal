      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="meta"><strong>App:</strong> DanceMe &nbsp;|&nbsp; <strong>Last updated:</strong> February 26, 2026</p>
    </header>

    <section class="card">
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>DanceMe</strong> ("the app", "we", "us") handles information when you use the app.
      </p>

      <div class="note">
        DanceMe creates AI dance videos from photos you upload. Generation is processed on remote servers and may take time to complete.
      </div>

      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>We collect information needed to operate the app, process video generation, and improve reliability.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Photos you upload</strong> for AI video generation</li>
        <li><strong>Generated video outputs</strong> while processing and delivering results</li>
        <li><strong>Anonymous app install identifier</strong> (stored securely on your device and used for app functionality such as continuity, credits, and generation-related records)</li>
        <li><strong>App usage analytics</strong> (via Firebase Analytics)</li>
        <li><strong>Crash and diagnostic data</strong> (via Firebase Crashlytics)</li>
        <li><strong>Purchase-related events</strong> for consumable credits (but not your full payment card data)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Anonymous App Identifier (Install ID)</h2>
      <p>
        DanceMe generates an anonymous app install identifier ("install ID") and stores it securely on your device (for example, in iOS Keychain) to support core app functionality.
      </p>
      <p>
        This identifier may be used when communicating with our backend services to help maintain continuity for features such as credits, generation requests, and related records without requiring a traditional user account.
      </p>
      <p>
        The install ID is not used for cross-app or cross-website advertising tracking.
      </p>

      <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
      <p>We use information to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Process and generate AI dance videos you request</li>
        <li>Deliver generation results to the app</li>
        <li>Maintain app functionality using an anonymous install ID (for example, continuity of credits and generation-related records)</li>
        <li>Operate and improve app performance and reliability</li>
        <li>Detect crashes, bugs, and service issues</li>
        <li>Support consumable credit purchases and refund credits for failed generations (when applicable)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Photos and AI Video Generation</h2>
      <p>
        When you choose a photo and start generation, your photo is transmitted to our processing infrastructure and service providers to create the requested video.
      </p>
      <p>
        Uploaded photos and generated outputs may be processed temporarily to complete generation and deliver the result. At launch, DanceMe is not intended to function as a permanent cloud gallery for user media.
      </p>
      <p>
        We aim to delete uploaded photos after generation processing according to our operational retention practices.
      </p>

      <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>We use third-party services to operate the app, including infrastructure, analytics, crash reporting, and payment processing.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Firebase Analytics</strong> (usage analytics)</li>
        <li><strong>Firebase Crashlytics</strong> (crash reporting and diagnostics)</li>
        <li><strong>Cloud processing/storage providers</strong> used to generate AI videos and deliver results</li>
        <li><strong>Apple App Store / In-App Purchases</strong> for consumable credit purchases</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These providers may process technical information necessary to provide their services, such as app/device diagnostics and request metadata.
      </p>

      <h2>Tracking and Advertising</h2>
      <p>
        We do <strong>not</strong> use third-party advertising SDKs and do <strong>not</strong> track you across apps or websites for advertising purposes. Any identifier used by DanceMe is used for app functionality, not advertising tracking.
      </p>

      <h2>In-App Purchases (Consumable Credits)</h2>
      <p>
        DanceMe offers consumable credit purchases to generate videos. Purchases are processed securely by Apple using your Apple ID.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not receive or store your full payment card information.
      </p>
      <p>
        Failed generations may be refunded as credits according to app logic and service outcome.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Retention</h2>
      <p>
        We retain information only as long as needed to operate the app, complete processing, maintain security, comply with legal obligations, and resolve disputes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Uploaded photos used for generation are intended to be temporary. Analytics and crash diagnostics may be retained by service providers according to their settings and policies.
      </p>

      <h2>Your Choices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You can choose whether to upload a photo</li>
        <li>You can stop using the app at any time</li>
        <li>You can manage photo permissions in iOS Settings</li>
        <li>You can contact us for privacy questions using the email below</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you want to make a privacy-related request, contact us and we will review your request in accordance with applicable law.
      </p>

      <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        DanceMe is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you believe a child under 13 has provided information to us, contact us and we will review and address the issue.
      </p>

      <h2>International Processing</h2>
      <p>
        Your information may be processed in countries other than your country of residence, depending on where our service providers operate.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will update the "Last updated" date on this page.
      </p>
