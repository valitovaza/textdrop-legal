      <p class="meta"><strong>App:</strong> DanceMe &nbsp;|&nbsp; <strong>Last updated:</strong> February 26, 2026</p>
    </header>

    <section class="card">
      <p>
        These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your use of <strong>DanceMe</strong> ("the app", "we", "us"). By using DanceMe, you agree to these Terms.
      </p>

      <div class="note">
        DanceMe lets you upload photos and generate AI dance videos using remote processing. Generation may take time and may fail depending on service conditions or input quality.
      </div>

      <h2>Eligibility</h2>
      <p>
        You must be at least 13 years old to use DanceMe. If you are under the age of majority in your jurisdiction, you must have permission from a parent or legal guardian.
      </p>

      <h2>Use of the App</h2>
      <p>You may use DanceMe only for lawful purposes and in compliance with these Terms.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use only photos you own or have permission to use</li>
        <li>Do not infringe copyrights, privacy rights, publicity rights, or other rights</li>
        <li>Do not use the app to create unlawful, abusive, or harmful content</li>
        <li>Do not attempt to disrupt, reverse engineer, or abuse the app or its services</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>User Content and Permissions</h2>
      <p>
        You are responsible for the photos you upload and for your use of generated videos.
      </p>
      <p>
        By submitting content for generation, you represent that you have the rights and permissions needed to use that content and to request processing.
      </p>
      <p>
        You grant us and our service providers a limited license to process your uploaded content solely for the purpose of generating and delivering the requested video, operating the app, and resolving support or reliability issues.
      </p>

      <h2>Prohibited Content and Conduct</h2>
      <p>You may not use DanceMe to upload, generate, or share content that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Violates any law or regulation</li>
        <li>Exploits or harms minors</li>
        <li>Contains non-consensual intimate or sexual content</li>
        <li>Infringes intellectual property or impersonates others in a misleading or harmful way</li>
        <li>Promotes violence, harassment, or hate</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We may limit or suspend access to the app if we reasonably believe these Terms are violated.
      </p>

      <h2>AI Generation and Results</h2>
      <p>
        DanceMe uses AI and remote processing to generate videos. Results may vary and may not always match your expectations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Generation times are estimates only and may vary based on demand, infrastructure availability, and input quality.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not guarantee uninterrupted service or successful generation for every request.
      </p>

      <h2>Consumable Credits and Payments</h2>
      <p>
        DanceMe uses consumable credits for video generation. Credit prices and package options may change over time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Purchases are processed by Apple through your App Store account and are subject to Apple's terms and policies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Credits are consumable and generally non-restorable after use. Failed generations may be refunded as credits according to app logic and service outcome.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may change the credit cost of templates or generation options at any time before purchase.
      </p>

      <h2>Availability and Changes</h2>
      <p>
        We may modify, update, suspend, or discontinue parts of the app at any time, including templates, generation settings, or pricing.
      </p>

      <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p>
        The app, including its design, branding, software, and templates (excluding your uploaded content and your rights in generated outputs to the extent applicable), is owned by us or our licensors and is protected by law.
      </p>

      <h2>Disclaimers</h2>
      <p>
        DanceMe is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis, without warranties of any kind to the fullest extent permitted by law.
      </p>
      <p>
        We disclaim warranties including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.
      </p>

      <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        To the fullest extent permitted by law, we will not be liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of data, profits, or business arising from your use of DanceMe.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our total liability for any claim relating to DanceMe will not exceed the amount you paid to us through the app in the 12 months before the claim, to the extent permitted by law.
      </p>

      <h2>Termination</h2>
      <p>
        We may suspend or terminate access to the app if you violate these Terms or misuse the service.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes to These Terms</h2>
